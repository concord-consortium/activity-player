We suggest teachers review the information and think about ways to scaffold students toward developing knowledge and practice as appropriate for their classes. We also recommend emphasizing the underlying ideas and practices, rather than on vocabulary terms. By discussing the different options, students can engage in productive talk related to these computational thinking concepts without using technical terminology. \\n\\nThis assessment probe is designed to assess and scaffold students in thinking and talking about **Rule Refinement** and, especially, **Rule Testing**. **Rule Refinement** involves refining a rule for use in a modeling environment using scientific principles and incorporating additional data, making the rule more precise, computational, and/or detecting and correcting errors. **Rule Testing** is a process of \\\"calibration\\\" between the modeling environment and the observable world. It involves systematically testing a rule to detect errors and limitations, and analyzing the efficiency of various solutions.\\n\\nThe assessment is situated in the unit context to provide an opportunity for students to make sense about rule refinement and rule testing in a specific, tangible weather problem. While one of the responses makes the most sense from a practical standpoint for this problem, other responses have implicit connections to facets of computational thinking (e.g., using understanding of systems to determine model rules and iteration in modeling). Using an indefinite problem provides space for students to think and talk about different approaches to refining and testing rules for a computer model. While having good data and using good science are important for refining rules, calibration (i.e., rule testing) of models of real-world environmental systems like the weather generally rely on comparisons between model outputs and real-world data as critical evidence of model accuracy and usefulness. \\n\",\"content2\":\"\",\"mediaType\":\"none\",\"mediaCaption\":\"Last, First. \\\"Title of Work.\\\" Year created.

We sometimes see this type of reasoning when students and even adults talk about climate change models. Some people say things like, “they are just models, so they don’t really tell us what’s going to happen in the real world.” \\n\\nStudents who choose Delana’s response could use support in developing understanding that computer models don’t need to be perfect in order to be useful. No model is perfectly accurate. Models just need to be good enough for a given purpose. Computer modelers set calibration targets that define how close to the actual event they want their prediction to be (e.g., maybe they want their model to predict the correct outcome of rain or no rain for the next day 95% of the time). Uncertainty is also built into weather models for precipitation in other ways (e.g., a forecast of 70% chance of rain for a given day). Knowing that there is a 70% chance of rain tomorrow is better than not having any information about tomorrow’s weather at all. Students who choose Delana’s response (as well as all the other students) could benefit from conversations about and examples of what it means for a model to be “good enough” to serve a purpose.\\n\\n###Middle Level \\n•\\t**Alex’s response (run the model longer)** suggests awareness that models are not perfect and that they can improve over time. This response may also appeal to some students who know about the idea of computer iteration (i.e., a process in which a set of instructions is repeated in a sequence multiple times or until a condition is met). Sometimes computer models need to run over time through multiple iterations to reach a certain set of criteria for the output. However, in this case, if the computer model is only making a correct prediction about half the time, then the computer needing more time to process the data probably isn’t the problem. \\n\\nStudents who choose Alex’s response could benefit from a discussion about whether or not they think running the model longer would help in this case.\\n\\n•\\t**Kalin’s response (keep working on rules using science)** has some merit. We do want to work on model rules based on scientific principles. However, when modeling a real-world system, it’s not enough to just use the rules of science to make our models. We need to know that our model is actually going to work (i.e., be sufficiently accurate in outputs such as predictions) when it is applied in the real world. Real-world systems are complex. If we just go by the rules of science, we may be overlooking possible problems with either the rules of the model (e.g., omitting an important variable) or with input data (e.g., perhaps a temperature sensor is faulty or isn’t calibrated correctly). In either case, just working on the rules of the model would not be enough to know that the model really works unless we check our weather model predictions against the weather that actually occurs.\\n\\n###More Formal Ideas\\n•\\t**Sage’s answer (refine and test model predictions using Alaska weather data)** is the only option that acknowledges the importance of using calibration to test model rules, which is essential for establishing confidence in a computer model that is designed to represent or simulate an event or phenomenon in the real world. Weather modelers need to compare their model outputs to real-world data to ascertain how well they are working. Calibration is a process of iteratively refining rules and testing with data until a target level of match between model output and real-world data is consistently achieved. Once this level of match (calibration) is achieved with sufficient consistency across multiple datasets, then the modeler can have an acceptable level of confidence in their model’s performance. Weather modelers can and should use scientific principles to design and refine their models, but without real-world evidence there is no way to check one’s model predictions against what really happens in the world. \\n\",\"content2\":\"\",\"mediaType\":\"none\",\"mediaCaption\":\"Last, First. \\\"Title of Work.\\\" Year created.
