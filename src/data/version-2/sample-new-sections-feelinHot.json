They explore real-world data on the frequency of wildfires and the number of acres burned over time. Students connect their ideas about the trends in the data to what might be causing the fluctuations. Students also begin to consider what makes wildfires hazardous and how they impact people and their communities.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

You can open and close this tip, and other teacher tips in this module by clicking on the orange \\\"Framing the Activity\\\" button above.**\\n\\nFires have been raging around the world, destroying homes and burning up millions of acres. \\nAs the world experiences extreme heat waves and droughts with more frequency due to climate change, firefighters will continue to struggle to bring these fires under control. These fires sharpen the call to take climate change more seriously and explore the role it plays in the development of these natural hazards. Climate change plays an important role; warmer temperatures means drier vegetation, which acts as perfect kindling for fires. Hot, dry winds also help spread wildfire. \\n\\nIt is the goal of this module to help students explore how the different components in the fire triangle-- oxygen, heat, fuel --are amplified as a result of a changing climate. In addition, we will provide students with the opportunity to consider the factors that transform a natural phenomenon into a natural hazard. Students will explore the risks, hazards, and impacts of wildfires on people and their communities. They will also consider environmental impacts to important ecosystems.\\n\\nIn line with the NGSS (see <a href=\\\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1evvprkL3XbujTLo0JEuP2KvcVF_NvM_yCOWP2tsFthQ/edit?usp=sharing\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"> Wildfire Module Standards Alignment</a>), this module engages students in the use of evidence gathered from exploration with the Wildfire Explorer, a model we developed to investigate variables that influence the spread and impacts of a wildfire on communities and environments in its path. \\n\\nStudent work throughout the module is driven by the guiding question: **How will wildfire risks and impacts change over the next 100 years?** \\n\",\"content2\":\"\",\"mediaType\":\"none\",\"mediaCaption\":\"Last, First. \\\"Title of Work.\\\" Year created.

These three words will be repeated throughout the module. Students should practice using these terms and distinguish between them. \\n\\n**A hazard is anything that has the potential to harm people or the environment.** The two hazards of wildfires are smoke and fire.\\n\\n**An impact is an outcome of a hazard.** Impacts can be positive or negative. Negative impacts of fire are buildings burning down, ecosystems being destroyed, and many others. Positive impacts include new vegetation growth and elimination of invasive species.\\n\\n**Risk is the likelihood of a hazard to cause a specific impact.** For example, southern California is at a high risk (degree of likelihood) of fire (the hazard) burning down homes (impact) when there is severe drought in the area. Risk involves some level of uncertainty with prediction because we can never exactly know what is going to happen.\",\"content2\":\"\",\"mediaType\":\"none\",\"mediaCaption\":\"Last, First. \\\"Title of Work.\\\" Year created.

This topic will be visited again later in the module. However, because of the complexity of this issue the module will only address a few of these issues.\\n\\nAt this point, eliciting students’ initial ideas about risks to different populations is important. Both preparing for wildfires (buying supplies and staying put) and evacuating (access to reliable transportation and having a safe place to go) can be expensive. Asking questions like, “Why is it more difficult for older people or sick people to prepare for a wildfire?” and \\\"Why is it more difficult for people from low socioeconomic communities to evacuate during a wildfire?\\\" will generate rich class discussions.\\n\\nWe suggest you use an off-line tool called a Summary Table to record student ideas. Summary Tables can be used individually by students to track their thinking as they progress toward an explanatory model of the phenomenon and guiding question: **How will wildfire risks and impacts change over the next 100 years? **\\n\\nA Summary Table can also be used to record student ideas in a public place, such as a poster or a projected online document shared at the front of the room.
